## What's SmartVscode?
**SmartVscode** aims to revolutionize how we interact with the powerful capabilities of Visual Studio Code by harnessing the simplicity and intuitiveness of natural language. Envision seamlessly toggling themes, connecting to remote servers, or even generate a mini-game â€” all articulated through natural language. This innovative method is designed to make coding more efficient and advanced, taking users into a new stage of interacting with software.

- ðŸ”¥ **Natural Language Command Interface**: Execute a wide array of VS Code commands simply by expressing your intention in natural language. No need to memorize complex command syntax or search through menusâ€”let the plugin understand and act upon your instructions.

- âž• **Automated Task Execution**: Streamline your development workflow with tasks automated by your descriptions. Whether you need to switch up your coding environment by changing themes and fonts or start a new project component like a mini-game, just ask and it's done.

- ðŸ“ƒ **Interactive Sidebar Conversations**: Engage in a dynamic conversation with your editor. Get instant responses right in your sidebar conversation window.
